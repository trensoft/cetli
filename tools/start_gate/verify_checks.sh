# The tag condition of docs/RELEASING.md ("The start gate"), checked by a machine: before the tag, is
# the start gate green on every chroot of the COPR project, on this commit?
# usage: tools/start_gate/verify_checks.sh SHA     (SHA: the 40 hex digits of the commit to be tagged)
#   1. the chroots of the COPR project are read from the COPR API (not from a file of this tree);
#   2. the check runs of the commit are read from the GitHub API;
#   3. for every COPR chroot there must be a check "start gate (<chroot>)" of GitHub Actions that is
#      completed with the conclusion success, and there must be no such check for a chroot that the
#      COPR project does not have (the matrix of the workflow and the COPR project are one list).
# Exit status 0 only when all of it holds. Anything that cannot be read (no network, an API error, no
# python3, an empty answer, more than 100 checks) is a failure, not a pass: no answer, no tag.
# GITHUB_TOKEN (optional) is sent to the GitHub API, which limits anonymous requests.
# START_GATE_REPO, START_GATE_COPR_OWNER, START_GATE_COPR_PROJECT, START_GATE_GITHUB_API and
# START_GATE_COPR_API change where it looks; they are for the tests of this script.
