# Needs podman or docker (START_GATE_ENGINE=docker|podman picks one). Not started by the tests: it
# downloads packages (CI runs it, see .github/workflows/start-gate.yml, and docs/RELEASING.md says
# when). The scripts it runs in the containers come from this directory, so the same gate can test an
# older tree or a changed copy of this one (negative_control.sh): TREE need not have this directory.
